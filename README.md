### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
my name is glodie nkahsama lukose. i'm passionate about computers and software in particular. The main language i use in software development is javascript, currently i'm learning the react framework. i also have knowledge in html, css and i use tailwindcss to style my web pages. 

i like to design solutions with the applications i create. i got into computing because i like to create, i like to design new things.

Recently I've become very passionate about virtual reality and augmented reality and I firmly believe that these two technologies will really revolutionise the way we live and do things.

I believe that Africa will make great strides in information technology in the future, and that this will be achieved through communities and open source.
